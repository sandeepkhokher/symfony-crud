A Symfony project created on November 26, 2016, 12:38 am.
# symfony-crud

It is quite easy to implement the CRUD operation in symfony and same has been implemented in the repository. It'll be quite useful for beginners and main motive behind creating this repository to let people know that Symfony is not as tough as depicted over web. An application is not only just about the CRUD operation but if you can set up the CRUD operation along with setting up framework then other requirements can be sorted out along with further developments.

If you have prior experience with any MVC based framework then you can learn symfony in no time.
